# ocp-diag-quickstart

This repository contains sample codebases that produce [OCP Test & Validation output](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/ocp-diag-core/blob/main/json_spec/README.md). They are intended to be used as a base to write new compliant diagnostics.

### Structure

Each language folder contains a quickstart sample that can be copy-pasted. In all cases, it is sufficient to change the name of the artifact after the copy, and continue to build your diagnostic logic on top. Any optional features are documented in their respective `README.md`.

### Contact

Feel free to start a new [discussion](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/ocp-diag-quickstart/discussions), or otherwise post an [issue/request](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/ocp-diag-quickstart/issues).
