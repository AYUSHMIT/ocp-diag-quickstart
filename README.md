# ocp-diag-quickstart

This repository contains sample diagnostics that produce [OCP Test & Validation output](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/ocp-diag-core/blob/main/json_spec/README.md). They are intended to be used as a base to write new compliant diagnostics.

- `OCP_Hello_World_Diagnostic.py` is a sample diagnostic that contains all message types in [OCP Test & Validation output](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/ocp-diag-core/blob/main/json_spec/README.md) and uses the Python [ocptv library](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/ocp-diag-core-python).
